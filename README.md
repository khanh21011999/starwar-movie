❌ App only run great on android, app not config for ios yet!

To run the app, run `yarn install` or `npm install` at root, then `npx react-native run android` to run the app

## Note
App use mock data from https://imdb-api.com/ (it limited 100 request) so mock it in case it out of request, mocked data still get from api (here swagger) 
https://imdb-api.com/swagger/index.html

❌ Unit testing is having problem (highly because of react native version)
